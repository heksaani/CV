about_content: "Hi, my name's Heidi currently pursuing a Master's in Life Science Informatics at the University of Helsinki. To enhance my skills I am also working part time as a research assistant at Folkhälsan Research Center.\nWhile I am very much interested in biological data my current interet are leaning more towards software development.\nI am also starting to work on my Master's thesis this coming Spring. It will focus on the pipelines used in analysing \nLong Read Sequencing data. \n "

    description: "It was a great learning experience as my first group project and I learned a lot about working in a team and using version control. We used <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Flask</mark> to create a web application \nthat allows users to upload citations and then download them in a bibtext format. We did all of this while using Scrum as our project management method\n"
